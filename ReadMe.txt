*** How to install ***

Unpack the BooBar directory into \Data\Gui\Customized\Flash\ located in the root of your The Secret World directory, so it looks like this:

\Data\Gui\Custom\Flash\BooBar\BooBar.swf
\Data\Gui\Custom\Flash\BooBar\CharPrefs.xml
\Data\Gui\Custom\Flash\BooBar\Modules.xml
\Data\Gui\Custom\Flash\BooBar\LICENSE.txt
\Data\Gui\Custom\Flash\BooBar\ReadMe.txt

PLEASE NOTE: Make sure you restart your client after installing this add-on. Always restart your client when adding XML files as these only get read on load.

Once you are happy with the castbar you can turn off the in game castbar be unchecking the "Interface Options->HUD Display->Show target castbar" option in SWL.

Delete the BooBar directory from \Data\Gui\Customized\Flash\
